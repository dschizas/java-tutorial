## Object oriented programming
Object-oriented programming is a method of programming based on a hierarchy of classes, and well-defined and cooperating objects.

## Concepts
### Object
An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

### Class
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

### Inheritance
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.

### Interface
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.

### Package
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.
